<h2>Understand Licensing Requirements</h2>
<p>To operate a ham radio, you'll need to pass an FCC-administered exam. There are three license classes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Technician License</strong>: This entry-level license grants access to local and some international communication on VHF and UHF bands.</li>
  <li><strong>General License</strong>: Provides broader access to HF bands, allowing for worldwide communication.</li>
  <li><strong>Amateur Extra License</strong>: Offers the most privileges across all frequencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each license requires passing a multiple-choice exam, with no age restrictions to take it. For the Technician License, expect to study basic electronics, radio theory, operating practices, and FCC regulations.</p>
