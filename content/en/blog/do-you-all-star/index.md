## Are You an AllStar? Or Is Your Repeater?

The **ARRL Iowa Section** and **K0IRO – Iowa Radio Operators** are looking to connect with repeater groups, system trustees, hotspot owners, and individual operators across Iowa.

Are you currently using or supporting an **AllStar node**—whether it’s tied to a repeater, running on a hotspot, or operating as a standalone node?

Or maybe you’ve been considering adding one and want to learn how straightforward it can be.

If you’d like to share your setup, ask questions, or explore what AllStar could bring to your station or club, we’d love to hear from you.  
You can reach us anytime at **[info@k0iro.com](mailto:info@k0iro.com)**.

We look forward to continuing the conversation and building stronger connections across Iowa’s amateur radio community.
