## Iowa Radio Operators (K0IRO) Club Survey

Your voice matters! Whether you're just dipping your toes into amateur radio or you're a seasoned pro, we want to make sure our club supports everyone in the best way possible.

But here’s the thing—we don’t know what we don’t know without your input! What topics excite you? What resources would be most valuable? What kind of events would keep you engaged?
That’s why we’ve put together a survey, and we need your feedback! 

Your insights will help us build a club that truly serves the community.

Click the link, take the survey, and let’s shape this club together!
