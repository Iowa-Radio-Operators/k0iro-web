## Parkmas and Repeater Challenge Winners Part 1

Sometimes the hardest part of being spread out across the state is actually getting prizes into the hands of the operators who earned them. But last weekend I finally had the chance to catch up with Jim – W6GRE and Scott – KE0ZBB, and it was great to hand out some well‑deserved recognition.

A huge congratulations again to Jim, our overall champion of the Repeater Challenge. His consistency and drive put him solidly at the top.
And right alongside him, Scott – KE0ZBB deserves a big shout‑out for taking 2nd place in the 12 Days of Parkmas. Scott put in the time, and the effort — and it showed. Parkmas isn’t a small lift, and he delivered.

Both of these guys put real energy into the hobby, and seeing their work pay off is exactly what keeps events like these fun and worth running.

More activity, more friendly competition, and more chances to celebrate the operators who keep Iowa talking.


Congratulations again to Jim for winning the overall repeater challenge

We will make sure we catch Trevor and Claus shortly and put their pictures up as well!


What fun would all this be if we didn't a blooper to include?
