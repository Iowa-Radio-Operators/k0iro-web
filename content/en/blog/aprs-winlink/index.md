## Introducing K0IRO-10 and K0IRO-15


As the dust of summer and fall are finally settling we have some exciting news about the work we've been putting in over the course of the summer and fall. More to come and eventually will get a page just to document this stuff.

Lets start out with the easier stuff to share!

### K0IRO-10 

The feedback I heard over and over was that APRS coverage was hit and miss over to the eastern side of the state. Even to a degree to the West. While working on the tower this summer we had an opportunity to free up an Antenna as we added other antenna's so we wanted to take the opportunity to try and add some capabilities and coverage. That's where K0IRO-10 spun up. It currently is hooked to an set of folded dipoles at 275 feet giving good 360 degree coverage. 

I feel like we've seen great coverage over the last couple of months across most of i80. Today's image doesn't reflect that but maybe that is a sign of the seasons. Either way still excellent coverage and hopefully a help to quite a few out there.

The current setup at the time of this writing is based off from a Motorola Maxtrac connected to a Microsat WX3in1. The Wx3in1 is acting not only as a digipeter, but an iGate to the internet. Don't laught too loudly at the mess I made putting this together, but this is what it looks like for the nerds who are generally cruious!

There is a second channel on the Motorola is there was a need for a special event coverage. Not sure if that would be helpful or not, but reach out if it is and we can go out there and flip it over as needed.

### K0IRO-15

This was another fun project that came to light really quick. In talking with some folks about ARES and what services might be useful in the event of a disaster Winlink came up. I did some looking and met with a few others around and decided to throw Winlink on the tower with a little bit of a twist. I am starting to fill up slots on the tower with RF that I didn't want to just add yet another antenna. I was gifted a couple of sinple cans and with a little bit of time and expirimenting was able to build a set that I could use the same antenna as the APRS radio but have enough pass/reject that they don't collide with each other. There is a scene in Star Trek III where they are returning to space dock and the part where they come up to the excellsior where Kirk utters "My Friends, The Great Expirement" ([The Video is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-igbPoFhcw&t=80s)). Well that's what we have here. The great Expirement. You would think it wouldn't work, but some how it does. Plenty of Accept and Reject on either side of the radio and initial testing don't hear any of the adjacent service on either radio.

With that said we have K0IRO-15. The Winlink RMS gateway in Central Iowa. This is a VHF radio setup and currently does not have capabilities for HF or UHF. I would love to explore how to forward somewhere that has HF capabilities should the internet go out in the shack for long periods of time (Hopefully it doesn't), so if you are able and interested in adding any HF capabilities long term reach out to me.
