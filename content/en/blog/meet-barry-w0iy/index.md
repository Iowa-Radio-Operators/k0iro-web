----------------------------------------------------------------

<h3>April 1, 2025</h3>
<p>I am Barry W0IY.</p>
<p>I am the new Iowa Section Manager. My motivation for running for SM was to make amateur radio better. I want to do this by enhancing clubs and doing youth outreach. More on that later. At the Section level, there are lots of things going on. As I campaigned, my focus was on my agenda, first to make clubs better, then to have clubs engage in outreach to youth. Through schools, Maker groups, Scouts, where ever we can go. That continues to be my main objective. However, there are important issues which need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Well before taking office, I’ve been involved with many members, clubs and EMA officials. There are lots of broken things to fix, both at the section and local level. It is going to take some time and effort, not just by me.</p>
<p>Until now, I’ve gone out of my way to not stir controversy, but common courtesy has not been extended to me. I was refused permission to speak briefly at the conclusion of the Weather Spotter training. My intention was to extend an invitation to all hams present to attend the next CVARC meeting. Apparently I was perceived as a threat to the waning center of power. Now is the time for us to raise our collective voice and express the depth our dissatisfaction. The disrespect heard of late is extremely unfortunate and not at all in alignment with the ARRL mission.</p>
<p>I heard from many hams, both locally and across the state, that they were eagerly anticipating a change in section management. This because they felt they were not being served.</p>
<p>I am here to serve the amateur radio community and make it a better.</p>

<h4>Leadership</h4>
<p>There is a very VERY important principle in leadership. Not everyone claiming to be a leader knows this. The principle is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a leader, I need you, WAY more than you need me. <sup>[1]</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think about that. “I” can’t do much. “WE” can do a lot. But to be a successful leader, I need to earn your respect. To earn that, I will respect and appreciate YOU. Leadership is not given by command or election to office, it is earned. I want to earn it from you. As the leader, am I the most important person in the room. Absolutely not. We are all volunteers. We should ALL be respected and appreciated. The LEADER needs to respect and appreciate the volunteers, not just issue commands to minions. If that isn’t understood, then you are not a leader. You are a dictator.</p>

<h3>Let's Talk ARES</h3>
<p>There has been too much emphasis put on ARES. The concept was promoted that ARES was the most important organization—that it took priority. Where does it say that? Nowhere! That emphasis was NOT based on what is best for amateur radio and the community. It was based on power and control. That era is over. DONE!!!</p>
<p>Now, I am presented with the task of having to pick up the pieces of a structure that did not have a true leader. Pieces that are broken. People are bailing out of ARES because it’s broken. I need to work on recovering trust, showing respect and appreciation, and rebuilding the relationship with EMA.</p>

<p>In the months to come, I am going to have to make difficult decisions, but I’m going to make them based on what is best for amateur radio, not what is best for me.</p>

<p>One difficult decision I am making is that all ARES activities in Linn County are suspended until further notice.</p>
<p>This action is necessary to rebuild a new ARES. There will be no loss of capability. CVARC’s EmComm is entirely capable of conducting weather nets, exercises, and deployments. These will be handled without direct ARES involvement. This situation will be resolved as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Eric KØECW is CVARC’s Emergency Preparedness Director. You elected him. He is well prepared and entirely capable of running this operation, and deserves to perform his duties without interference. I appointed him Linn County Emergency Coordinator based on his qualifications and dedication.</p>
<p>You need to understand that by joining ARES, you are indicating your willingness to support EmComm through the ARRL. The League encourages ARES membership and activities as it supports the FCC’s mandate that amateur radio provide emergency communications.</p>
<p>Certainly in Linn County, many members of CVARC are also members of ARES. There is no difference based on the name on a hat or vest. You are there to help. CVARC has resources and is entitled to use them as it sees fit:</p>
<ul>
<li>CVARC has a repeater, not ARES.</li>
<li>CVARC can have a weather net without ARES.</li>
<li>CVARC can deploy the trailer without ARES.</li>
<li>CVARC has a repeater which does not belong to ARES.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Current Issues</h4>
<p>As an example of the problems with ARES, the LinnCountyARES discussion group on groups.io has been hijacked. Please leave the group as it is NOT authorized by ARES. If an activity is announced there, please ignore the event. There is a new group you are welcome and encouraged to join. Please carefully note the spelling as the names are slightly different.</p>

<h3>On groups.io:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>LinnCountyARES</strong>: OLD and BOGUS</li>
<li><strong>LinnCountyIAARES</strong>: NEW and IMPROVED! Real ARES</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p>The same situation exists with the Iowa ARES group. It has been hijacked and is no longer speaking for ARES. The reasons for this difficulty are entirely for someone's need for personal power rather than the good of amateur radio.</p>
<p>Additionally, the website <strong>ARRLIOWA.ORG</strong> has been erased. I requested the domain name, but it was not made available. Couldn’t this have been done for the good of amateur radio? Obviously not. A new website will be announced shortly.</p>

<hr>

<h3>In summary:</h3>
<p>ARES needs to heal. Please be patient as we fix what’s broken. We’ll be back as soon as we can.</p>

<hr>

<h3>The Future of the Iowa Section:</h3>
<p>To be perfectly clear, the new Iowa Section leadership is bringing a much-needed new leadership style. I expect that my example of respecting and appreciating volunteers will be carried out at all levels.</p>

<p>At the Iowa Section level, many appointments are out of date. There are 5 known SKs with current Section appointments—some are deceased for many years. My Elmer, <strong>Les WØYLS</strong>, has been SK for almost 5 years, yet he still has a current appointment. CVARC’s own <strong>NØSS</strong>, who administered my Extra test, has been gone awhile—a true gentleman. I miss seeing him at meetings.</p>

<p>Other appointees are not actively performing their duties. This is the result of neglect. Expect to see lots of appointment changes.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Clubs:</h3>
<p>I want to focus on clubs—making them stronger and more dynamic. Why? Because a group of old guys just having coffee doesn’t attract new members. A few years ago, we joked that everyone came to the CVARC meeting on the LIFTS bus.</p>

<p>Why are we here? To get together with our own kind. Call us nerds or whatever. Do we come to bicker over the budget and the minutes? No.</p>

<p>Clubs all have the “meeting before/after the meeting.” This is the real value of gathering. Dinner before or pizza after is a tradition in many clubs. We gather for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Camaraderie</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enjoyment</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Esprit de corps</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I want to get clubs to bring these elements to the forefront. You should be here because YOU REALLY WANT to be here. Attending should make you HAPPY.</p>

<h3>CVARC Improvements</h3>
<p>CVARC was already improving discussions with table topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who has a new radio?</li>
<li>New antenna. Who needs antenna help?</li>
<li>POTA (Parks On The Air)</li>
<li>AREDN (Amateur Radio Emergency Data Network)</li>
<li>Even 3D printing</li>
<li>Show and Tell</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the real reasons we're here. We're here to make amateur radio better for all of us.</p>
<p>Tim NØCKR is the new Club Coordinator. He is very enthusiastic and I am happy and grateful to have him participate. We have been actively contacting clubs across the state, inviting them to join in a club discussion group. Response has been VERY positive, because clubs DO want to get better.</p>
<p>In the coming months, you’ll see more activities and topics discussed at CVARC that are related to the clubs initiative. CVARC is doing many things right and is a huge club compared to the many smaller clubs in the state. Tim and I are going to see how we can help the clubs, regardless of size.</p>
<p>We look forward to WORKING WITH YOU to improve CVARC and all clubs in Iowa.</p>
<p>I am available to discuss any of this or other topics with you. Please email, it’s much easier to track than phone calls. But call if you prefer.</p>
<p>I am here to serve the amateur radio community.</p>
