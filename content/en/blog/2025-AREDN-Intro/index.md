# AREDN - Amateur Radio Emergency Data Network

Hold up ... let's pause right there. That little "E" in AREDN has always stood for Emergency—but honestly, I think it deserves a promotion. In my mind, that E should stand for Everything. Because that's exactly what AREDN can be: not just a tool for emergencies, but a part of our everyday amateur radio lives.

Sure, AREDN was originally envisioned as a network solution to shine in high-stakes, high-adrenaline emergency situations. And it does that brilliantly. But here's the thing: if we only dust it off during a crisis, we're missing out on its true potential. By weaving AREDN into our daily amateur radio practice, we not only stay sharp and familiar with the gear—we also unlock a world of creative uses that keep us prepared long before disaster ever strikes.

And the beauty of it? AREDN works whether we know each other or not. Imagine this: complete strangers from opposite sides of the world show up at the same event. We unpack our gear, power up our nodes, and within 20 minutes everything is talking together like old friends. No need for introductions. No need for backstory. Just plug, play, and let the mesh do its magic. Stick with the AREDN defaults when building your node, and you'll find your equipment fitting in seamlessly—like sliding into a conversation with high school buddies you haven't seen in years.

Let's peel back the layers a bit.

At the heart of it all is the firmware. AREDN runs on a specialized flavor of DD-WRT that unlocks the full potential of off-the-shelf networking hardware. Brands like Ubiquiti, Mikrotik, and TP-Link dominate the roster, with more being added as support expands. The magic lies in its mesh design: every node, whether on the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bands, knows about every other node. Together, they create a living, breathing network that automatically finds the best path for traffic. If a link weakens or drops, the mesh instantly reroutes through a stronger connection—over and over, keeping the system resilient.

And yes, you might be thinking: "Wait, 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz ... isn't that just like my home Wi-Fi?" Technically, yes. But here's where the amateur radio advantage kicks in: we have access to special slices of spectrum just above and below the standard consumer frequencies. Those "sweet spots" let us operate with less interference, more distance, and in many cases, better throughput. It's like having a VIP lane on the information superhighway.

"So what can AREDN actually do?" you might ask. AREDN can do anything and everything you do today at home, work, and school. Can you browse the web? Yes if someone is sharing their Internet connection with the mesh. Can you watch Netflix? Technically yes if someone is sharing their Internet connection but you will seriously degrade network performance that could be better used elsewhere. Since AREDN was founded under the principle of being a data networking tool for emergency communications lets dial back into that thought. During an emergency what is the first thing any responder should look for, track, and maintain throughout the event? Situational Awareness. AREDN can be utilized as an aid when it comes to situational awareness because we can deploy network based cameras and have them feed back to Net Control and other locations throughout the area that would benefit from those extra "eyes".

Here's an example, the Especially For You 5K and Family Walk held on Oct 5th - we deployed X cameras around the course. We were able to feed those cameras back to software on a Laptop in the eComms Trailer that was parked on 10th street near the Start/Finish line. At the trailer we had a large screen TV with the cameras up for served agencies at Ground Zero to view the course. Also Amateur Radio Operators were staged at the EOC with members from EMA on site being our "Eagles In The Sky" viewing the camera feeds as well and if a situation arose they could dispatch help or take over watching the course while an operator on site tended to a situation near them.

Another example, we just completed a SET on Oct 11th. We didn't fully test the abilities of AREDN during this event but we were able to do some pen-testing to see where we had weak spots so we could continue the planning and expansion of the AREDN network all over Linn County.

Another "communication tool" we've been working with is IP Phones. Currently at the Linn County EOC we have a PBX server where we can connect phones to extensions and be able to call each other, the EOC, and we even have a phone programmed in the Comms Room at Mercy Hospital in Downtown Cedar Rapids. While that specific phone may not be used other than once a year, it is still a vital piece of communication when our world may come crashing down around us.

Recently-ish, the majority of us went through the Flood of 08, the Flood of 16, and the Derecho in 2020, operators have been staged in that Comms Room because our primary source of communications—a 2M radio and antenna—are already staged there, tested yearly with thanks to the Especially For You event, so it just makes sense to expand our communications ability by bringing AREDN to the table.

There is a desire to build out further into the state of Iowa for Amatuer and Emergency purposes! Contact Kraig for more information or look for the AREDN channel on the Iowa Radio Operators Discord!
