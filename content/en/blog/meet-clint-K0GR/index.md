<h2>Hello Fellow Emergency Communicators!</h2>

<p>My name is Clint Miller KØGR, and I am the New Iowa Section Emergency Coordinator. I appreciate Barry Buelow W0YI for appointing me to fill this vital role. I hope I can meet or exceed your expectations of what strong section leadership for ARES should be.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>I was originally licensed in 2001 as KC0JUO to participate in a cross-country race with the ISU Solar Car Team. I got radio active in 2005 after hearing an NPR report about amateur radio operators responding to Hurricane Katrina.</p>

<h3>Leadership & Future Plans</h3>

<p>One of my first priorities is to have Assistant Section Emergency Coordinators (ASEC) and District Emergency Coordinators (DEC) that I know and trust to serve as a cabinet of advisors.</p>

<p>The section leadership team is planning a Statewide ARES Meeting to be held on a Saturday in the second half of July or August at the ISU College of Veterinary Medicine in Ames.</p>

<h3>EC Monthly Reporting</h3>

<p>One very timely order of business for the ECs is to complete the monthly reporting to the ARRL. You will need to use your ARRL login credentials to access this website: <a href="https://ares.arrl.org/aresform2.php">ARRL ARES Reporting</a>.</p>

<p>Apologies for the length of this message, but I’m sure there are several things that I forgot to mention—look for more updates soon. Feel free to reach me directly via email at ares.ia.sec@gmail.com.</p>
