## Story County Amateur Radio Club's Statewide POTA Gathering

What’s better than a beautiful day outdoors with radios buzzing and contacts rolling in? 

This past weekend, amateur radio operators from across the state met up for the [Story County Amateur Radio Club’s](http://www.w0yl.com/) Parks on the Air (POTA) gathering. The mix of new faces and seasoned operators made for a great time, filled with plenty of chatter—both on and off the air.

Beyond the radio waves, the gathering was just as much about swapping stories and sharing a few laughs. There’s something special about bringing people together with a shared passion—and this event proved, once again, why POTA has become such a great excuse to get outside and get on the air.

Some Pictures from the event:

If you weren’t able to make it this time, don’t worry—there’s another great chance to get on the air soon! The 2025 Iowa QSO Party is happening on Saturday, September 20, running from 9 AM to 9 PM, and the Story County Amateur Radio Club is hosting. Whether you’re logging contacts from home, hitting the field for another activation, or just listening in, it’s bound to be a fantastic event.
