<p>We are more than a club—we're a statewide hub for amateur radio enthusiasts, dedicated to fostering community, education, and collaboration. Our mission is to bridge the gap for operators without access to local clubs, offering resources and opportunities to connect and grow. </p>

<p>Partnering with local clubs, we aim to enrich the shared experience of learning and communication. Together, we’re advancing the craft, embracing innovation, and building a vibrant network of radio operators across Iowa.</p>
