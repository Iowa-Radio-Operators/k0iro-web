<h2>🎙️ K0IRO – Iowa Repeater Challenge 2025 🚀</h2>
<br>
<p><strong>CQ! CQ! Calling All Iowa Hams!</strong></p>

<p>
Get ready to twist those dials and fire up those mics—Club K0IRO is throwing down the gauntlet with the <strong>Iowa Repeater Challenge</strong>, running <strong>July 1 to December 31, 2025</strong>!
</p>

<p>
The mission? Simple: Hop on as many Iowa repeaters as you can—local, neighboring, or ones you bump into while on the road—and start making contacts! One contact? Great. Two? Even better. A whole string of them? Now we’re talking!
</p>

<p>
👉 <strong>Log your contacts</strong> using our contact form, and each month we’ll tally the scores, post the results, and crown a monthly repeater royalty—<em>could be you</em> with the bragging rights and glory! 👑
</p>

<p>
Why now? Because repeater activity has been getting a little too quiet lately, and if we don’t keep those frequencies alive, we might just lose them. <strong>Yikes!</strong> Let’s make some noise, have some fun, and remind the FCC that Iowa hams are loud, proud, and on the air!
</p>

<p>
Challenge your friends, your club, or that guy down the block with the big tower. Let’s bring our repeaters back to life—<em>one QSO at a time!</em>. 
</p>

<p>Don't forget to also join in on the conversation on <a href="https://discord.gg/yjEn8jrSQN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord</a>.</p>


<p><strong>📡 Ready, set… transmit!</strong></p>
